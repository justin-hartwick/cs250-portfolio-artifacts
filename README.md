## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves translating what the user wants into actionable tasks. User stories provide structure and context by framing the goal from the user’s perspective: “As a user, I want [something], so that [some benefit].” This keeps development focused on outcomes that matter, not just technical features. In the SNHU Travel project, we used user stories to prioritize features like an interactive slideshow and personalized recommendations, ensuring the product was aligned with user expectations.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I now approach development through an iterative, feedback-driven process. Agile taught me to build in short, focused sprints, always ready to adapt. Processes like backlog grooming, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives helped our team stay aligned and responsive. I plan to carry forward the use of Kanban boards, regular team check-ins, and continuous testing into all my future work—whether solo or collaborative.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being accountable, communicative, and collaborative. In Agile, it’s important to keep everyone informed, help resolve blockers, and contribute to team goals. It’s not just about completing your own tasks—it’s about supporting the whole team. During the SNHU Travel project, clear communication and willingness to adapt were essential for delivering a product that reflected the team’s best effort. Helping clarify user stories, adjusting to scope changes, and participating actively in retrospectives are all part of being a strong, reliable contributor.
